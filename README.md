# FXMessages
`FXMessages` is a small Java and JavaFX application we created to test [OpenJFX #118](https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/118) solutions and make demos.

It should become a communication app like Google Messages but with scientifical writing capabilities.

- Thanks their virtuale machines (VM) Java and JavaFX are cross plateform programming languages : Write Once and Run Anywhere. So FXMessages should be available on Windows, Linux, Mac OS, IOS with PC, ARM, Raspberrry Pi, ... hardware.
- On DeskTop, one can enter signs like ∞, ∈, × , ⩽, α, ..., δ, ... ω, ..., Δ, ... but also square root, fraction, ... simply by typing `.Del` ... or `.frac` ... (Δ sign and fraction).
- On Android, you can download it from :
  - this repository in the [Realease Page](https://github.com/scientificware/FXMessages/releases).
  - the Amazon App Store [FXMessage X1](https://www.amazon.fr/ScientificWare-FXMessages-X1/dp/B07NWSSLKZ/)
  - we also post an Android apk Google Play : [FXMessages X1](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fxmessages).
  
  We did it for our own tests with Android API, JavaFX port and Play Store process. Presently, only [OpenJFX #118](https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/118) solutions are implemented. You won't find other functionnalities, we are still working on them. But you're free to use it and to comment.
